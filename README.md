# Pizza-Sales-Analysis
This is a raw data gotten on the internet which shows the different types of pizzas bought from a particular store. Analysis was done on this data to find out different measures, using SQL to query the data and Power BI for data visualization. The data was first downloaded in a CSV format, then uploaded on SQL in order to run my queries, which was documentd and will also will uploaded in the files section. After running the queries and finding the needed values, this data was connected to Power BI inorder to visualize it. The first thing that was done after the data was imported to Power BI was data transformation, certain values were needed inorder to generate a better visualization. Finally, the data visualization was done for this project.
The raw data, the SQL queries and the Power B file will all be uploaded on the files section.
